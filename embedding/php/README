Notes for building and using the PHP embedding
Contact: Joseph Smarr (joseph@plaxo.com)
----------------------------------------

1. Install spidermonkey (Mozilla's JavaScript-C Engine)

   We're using verion 1.5: 
   http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/older-packages/js-1.5.tar.gz
   Extract it and run "make -f Makefile.ref" in the js/src dir

2. Build the C++ embedding library, see ../cpp/README. If you want a self contained php module that doesn't depend on any
   other shared libraries, pass --disable-shared to configure on the command line when configuring the C++ library.

3. Run phpize to prep the build environment:

   phpize

4. Tell configure where your spidermonkey library is

  ./configure --with-sm-obj=path_to_obj_dir

  For example, if spidermonkey is located in /home/joseph/js on a linux system, the configure line might look like this:

  ./configure --with-sm-obj=/home/joseph/js/src/Linux_All_DBG.OBJ

5. Build the library sgnodemapper.so

   Type make in this dir (if you get errors, make sure you build and pointed to spidermonkey)

6. Enable the sgnodemapper.so php module

   Copy the included sgnodemapper.ini to /etc/php.d or add "extension=sgnodemapper.so" to your php.ini

7. Call the code from your program. Here's a command line example:

   php -r ' $nodeMapper = new SGNodeMapper("../../nodemapper.js"); echo $nodeMapper->graphNodeFromURL("http://www.flickr.com/photos/jsmarr");'

   The above command produces the following output:

   sgn://flickr.com/?ident=jsmarr
