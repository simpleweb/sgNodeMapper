Notes for building and using the C++ embedding

----------------------------------------

1. Install spidermonkey (Mozilla's JavaScript-C Engine)

   We're using verion 1.5: 
   http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/older-packages/js-1.5.tar.gz
   Extract it and run "make -f Makefile.ref" in the js/src dir

2. Tell configure where your spidermonkey source is

  ./configure --with-sm-src=path_to_js_src_dir --with-sm-obj=path_to_obj_dir

  For example, if spidermonkey is located in /home/joseph/js on a linux system, the configure line might look like this:

  ./configure --with-sm-src=/home/joseph/js/src --with-sm-obj=/home/joseph/js/src/Linux_All_DBG.OBJ

3. Build the library libsgnodemapper.so

   Type make in this dir (if you get errors, make sure you build and pointed to spidermonkey)

4. Add the library to your environment

   Move libsgnodemapper.so to a known library dir in your system, or add the dir with 
   libsgnodemapper.so to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   
   You can also just type "make install"

5. Call the code from your program

   Look at the sample sgnodemapper_util program to see how to use it.
