Note:  do not edit files in this directory directly.  They're
automatically generated by running "make" in the parent directory.

These were previously by-products generated by "make test" and
explicitly ignored so they weren't checked into subversion.  That is
no longer the case.  The files in the root are still generated and
ignored, but only on a successful "make test" are they copied into
this directory.

The advantages to putting pre-built versions of these files in svn is
that people can then include them in HTML, right from:

   http://google-sgnodemapper.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/autogen/

Also, the Selenium regression tests can include them for regular
testing in all browsers to make sure we didn't accidentally use some
JavaScript-implementation-specific detail of JavaScript.
