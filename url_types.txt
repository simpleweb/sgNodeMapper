You should implement "ident_to_<foo>" for the following URL types:

 rss
 atom
 profile -- the "profile" page of the user, with their bio/pic/overview, etc
 content -- the HTML content page of the user.  may be their profile.
 chat    -- chat URL.  likely "aim:" or "xmpp:" or "callto:", etc.
 openid  -- openid server endpoint
 addfriend -- URL to add them

'feed' -- tries first atom, then rss
