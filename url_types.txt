You should implement "ident_to_<foo>" for the following URL types:

 rss     -- of content
 atom    -- of content
 profile -- the "profile" page of the user, with their bio/pic/overview, etc
 content -- the HTML content page of the user.  may be their profile.  whatever
            the notable thing on this site normally is.  for myspace, for instance,
	    this is the profile page, since blogs aren't commonly used/linked
	    on myspace.
 blog    -- url to their blog.
 chat    -- chat URL.  likely "aim:" or "xmpp:" or "callto:", etc.
 openid  -- openid server endpoint
 addfriend -- URL to add them

'feed' -- tries first atom, then rss
