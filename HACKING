Before we can accept a patch from you, you must sign a Contributor
License Agreement (CLA). The CLA protects you and us.

    * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're
      sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an
      individual CLA:

    * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute
      your work to sgnodemapper, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA:
